# DeepPrivacy2 Modifications Summary

This document describes all the modifications made to the original DeepPrivacy2 codebase for Docker-based face anonymization processing.

## Overview

The original DeepPrivacy2 repository has been enhanced with custom Docker wrapper scripts to enable easy batch processing of face anonymization on image datasets.

## Original Repository

- **Source**: https://github.com/hukkelas/deep_privacy2
- **Cloned on**: August 27, 2025
- **Original README**: `readme.md`

## Modifications Made

### 1. Custom Shell Scripts Added

Three new executable shell scripts were created to simplify Docker-based usage:

#### 1.1 `run_face_anonymization.sh`
- **Purpose**: Single image face anonymization
- **Usage**: `./run_face_anonymization.sh <input_image_path> <output_image_path>`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic Docker container management
  - Volume mounting for input/output directories
  - Error handling and status reporting
  - English-only interface

#### 1.2 `run_fullbody_anonymization.sh`
- **Purpose**: Single image full-body anonymization
- **Usage**: `./run_fullbody_anonymization.sh <input_image_path> <output_image_path>`
- **Features**:
  - Full-body anonymization using FB_cse configuration
  - Visualization support enabled
  - Automatic Docker container management
  - English-only interface

#### 1.3 `run_batch_anonymization.sh`
- **Purpose**: Batch processing of multiple images
- **Usage**: `./run_batch_anonymization.sh <input_directory> <output_directory> [face|fullbody]`
- **Features**:
  - Supports both face and full-body anonymization modes
  - Automatic image detection (jpg, jpeg, png, bmp)
  - Progress tracking with counters
  - Batch processing with status reporting
  - Default mode: face anonymization
  - English-only interface

### 2. Docker Configuration Enhancements

#### 2.1 Volume Mounting Strategy
- **Source code mounting**: `/home/zhiqics/sanjian/testdocker/deep_privacy2` → `/home/zhiqics/deep_privacy2`
- **Input directory mounting**: Dynamic mounting based on script parameters
- **Output directory mounting**: Dynamic mounting based on script parameters
- **Working directory**: Set to `/home/zhiqics/deep_privacy2` inside container

#### 2.2 Docker Image Usage
- **Base image**: Built from original Dockerfile
- **Image name**: `deep_privacy2`
- **Size**: ~16GB
- **Features**: CPU-mode operation (GPU support available but not required)

### 3. Processing Workflow Improvements

#### 3.1 Automated Directory Management
- Automatic creation of output directories
- Path validation and error handling
- File existence checks

#### 3.2 Batch Processing Optimizations
- Support for multiple image formats
- Individual file processing with error isolation
- Progress reporting during batch operations
- Automatic filename prefix addition (`anonymized_`)

### 4. Language Standardization

#### 4.1 Interface Language
- **Original**: Mixed Chinese and English comments
- **Modified**: Pure English interface
- **Changes**:
  - All user-facing messages converted to English
  - All comments and documentation in English
  - Error messages standardized in English

#### 4.2 Script Documentation
- Clear usage examples
- Standardized parameter descriptions
- Consistent error messaging

## Usage Examples

### Single Image Processing
```bash
# Face anonymization
./run_face_anonymization.sh /path/to/input.jpg /path/to/output.jpg

# Full-body anonymization
./run_fullbody_anonymization.sh /path/to/input.jpg /path/to/output.jpg
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Face anonymization (default)
./run_batch_anonymization.sh /input/directory /output/directory

# Face anonymization (explicit)
./run_batch_anonymization.sh /input/directory /output/directory face

# Full-body anonymization
./run_batch_anonymization.sh /input/directory /output/directory fullbody
```

## Successful Test Case

### Test Dataset Processing
- **Input**: `/home/zhiqics/sanjian/test_dataset/images/Train/` (394 images)
- **Output**: `/home/zhiqics/sanjian/output/deep_privacy2_results/` (394 processed images, 408MB)
- **Processing mode**: Face anonymization
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully completed
- **Processing time**: ~3-4 hours (CPU mode)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Docker with sufficient disk space (>20GB recommended)
- Original DeepPrivacy2 dependencies (handled by Docker image)
- Bash shell environment

### System Requirements
- **Minimum RAM**: 8GB (recommended for batch processing)
- **Storage**: 20GB+ free space for Docker images and models
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for reasonable processing speed
- **GPU**: Optional (will use CPU mode if GPU not available)

### File Permissions
All shell scripts are executable with proper permissions (`chmod +x`).

## Differences from Original

### What's Added
1. Three custom shell wrapper scripts
2. Automated Docker workflow
3. Batch processing capabilities
4. English-only interface
5. Enhanced error handling
6. Progress tracking for batch operations

### What's Unchanged
- Original DeepPrivacy2 core functionality
- Model configurations and weights
- Image processing algorithms
- Docker image build process
- Original documentation (preserved as `readme.md`)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. GPU acceleration support in wrapper scripts
2. Configuration file support for batch processing
3. Resume capability for interrupted batch jobs
4. Quality settings and output format options
5. Parallel processing support
6. Web interface for easier usage

## Maintenance Notes

- Scripts are designed to be self-contained and portable
- Docker image needs to be rebuilt if base dependencies change
- Volume mount paths are currently hardcoded for this specific setup
- Model weights are automatically downloaded on first use
